# GameAI changes
This code is altered to add the NEAT algoritm for the course Modern Game AI algoritms.

The main changes focus on removing the menu en adding an emulator layer which dictates the training process and start maps create players, controll players, etc.

Emulator file -> emulator.lua, emulatorFunctions.lua
Agent controller -> MarioAI.lua

Also in other files some minor changes have been made, such as replacing the standard Mario.lua object with the MarioAI.lua object.
